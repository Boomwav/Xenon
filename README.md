# Xenon
Variant of the [Helium Theme](https://github.com/darklinkpower/Helium) for [Playnite](https://github.com/JosefNemec/Playnite) Desktop Mode.

## Theme goals
- Customize the UI to give more importance to Achievements, HLTB, Steam News and Screenshots
- Reduce the size of the videos that took too much space to my liking.
- Reduce the fluff in the screenshot section.
- Keep the header clean by removing the screenshot button in the header.
  
## Installation
- Download the latest packaged `pthm` theme file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/boomwav/Xenon/releases/latest) and open it.
